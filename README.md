# autobash
A bunch of useful automation scripts for Ubuntu 14.04

# Important
These have only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04! I cannot help you if it doesn't work on another version of Linux. Sorry!!
Also, the /noneedtodl/ folder is not needed to use these scripts. It's simply a place for me to safely store all of the things I call in my scripts.

(also yes I know that you don't need to sudo echo, but I do it anyway because it makes it look uniform)
